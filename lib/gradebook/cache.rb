    Cache performs GET requests by first checking to see if a disk cached version exists.  If it does a conditional GET is performed with an etag extracted from the cache.
    If a response code of '304' is returned nothing has changed on line and the cached version is returned.  A response code of '200' means there is an updated version online 
    in which case another GET request is performed without the etag.  The new version is cached to disk.  If the file does not exist a full GET request is performed.  All cases return 
    an xml file.
