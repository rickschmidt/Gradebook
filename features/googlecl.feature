Feature: google command line tool is used to access google docs
    
    In order to use the gradebook 
    As an instructor
    I want to create a spreadsheet with the coures name using the command line
    
    Scenario: create a new spreadsheet with a course name using googlecl
        Given an authenticated client
        
        Given a course name

        When I receive the create command
        
        When I use the the list command
        
        When I use the get command with a Doc Title and path for download
        
        When I use the delete command with google cl and a specific google doc name
